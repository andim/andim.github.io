We aim to bring together new academics at UCL to create an **opportunity for sharing knowledge and social exchange**. 

There will be a couple of talks from people that we think offer an interesting perspective and valuable advice on these first few years running a research group; a professional photographer to take headshots; an exciting arts session (with drinks) at the Slade; and plenty of refreshments and breaks to keep us going throughout the day.

There is no registration fee, but prior [registration](https://lu.ma/gde2kquj) is required to help us gauge attendance.
