After an initial training in statistical physics in Göttingen and Paris, I worked on how evolution shapes immune defense strategies for my PhD at École Normale Supérieure in the [statistical biophysics group](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens). As a Lewis-Sigler Theory Fellow at [Princeton University](https://lsi.princeton.edu/) I further developed my interest in evolutionary immunology and started to ask more practical questions around how to turn advances in measuring immunological processes into quantitative models. Notably, combining theory and data analysis I uncovered quantitative principles that govern the regulation of T cell dynamics at multiple timescales. As of 2022, I have opened up the QImmunoLab at UCL and I am excited to do so at a time that is ripe for major advances in the grand challenge of understanding immunity quantitatively.

Interested in learning the sequence determinants of TCR specificity.

**You?**  
*Immunologist? Physicist? Data Scientist?*

We are looking for enthusiastic researchers at all levels to join us on our journey. Interested in working on some of the most fundamental questions in immunology using cutting edge machine learning techniques? Excited about studying the physics of living systems in an important and tractable model system? Please reach out!
