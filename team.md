After an initial training in statistical physics in Göttingen and Paris, I obtained my PhD at École Normale Supérieure in the [statistical biophysics group](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens) having worked on how evolution shapes immune defense strategies. As an independent postdoctoral fellow at [Princeton University](https://lsi.princeton.edu/)  a major focus of my research has been on the question of how T cell dynamics are regulated. To address this question I have developed theoretical and computational approaches to make quantitative sense of the recent deluge of sequencing data. As of 2022, I have opened up the QImmunoLab at UCL and I am excited to do so at a time that is ripe for major advances in the grand challenge of understanding immunity quantitatively.  

**You?**  
*Immunologist?, Data Scientist?, Math aficionado?*

We are looking for enthusiastic researchers at all levels to join us on our journey. Interested in working on some of the most fundamental questions in immunology using cutting edge machine learning techniques? Excited about studying the physics of living systems in an important and tractable model system? Please reach out!
