After an initial training in statistical physics in Göttingen and Paris, Andreas obtained his PhD at École Normale Supérieure in the [statistical biophysics group](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens) having worked on how evolution shapes immune defense strategies. As an independent postdoctoral fellow at [Princeton University](https://lsi.princeton.edu/)  a major focus of his research has been on the question of how T cell dynamics are regulated. To address this question he has developed theoretical and computational approaches to make quantitative sense of the recent deluge of sequencing data. As of 2022, Andreas has opened up a Quantitative Immunology Lab at UCL and he is excited to do so at a time that is ripe for major advances in the grand challenge of understanding immunity quantitatively.
