We aim to bring together researchers with an interest in quantitative immunology to create an **opportunity for sharing knowledge and social exchange**. It is going to be a day of conviviality and scientific enthusiasm with a dynamic and informal atmosphere. Talks from invited speakers will be interleaved with short presentations by young investigators (contributions welcome!). The schedule includes ample breaks for discussions and, for those interested, we propose to conclude the day in a local pub.

Immunology is being transformed through a multitude of quantitative approaches. Correspondingly, we expect the day to be of interest to researchers from diverse backgrounds from immunology, evolution, and cell biology, to systems biology, bioinformatics, and the physics of living systems. **No matter your background, you are welcome to join us!**

There is no registration fee, but we encourage prior [registration](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=_oivH5ipW0yTySEKEdmlwsefyMHuSa9KkArfAHERWzNUQ0tOMlJIMElFUEVLNTM0T0RHMk9XSDZaSy4u) to help us gauge attendance.

## We want YOU!

We highly encourage you to contribute to the London QImmuno day - works in progress and contributions from early career researchers are particularly welcome!

There are three possible formats:

(1) a **short talk** during one of the main sessions  
(2) a **whiteboard talk**: a talk without slides where you will explain your project interactively to a small audience with the support of a marker and a whiteboard  
(3) a **poster** 

If you would like to be considered for any of the three, please indicate so when [registering](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=_oivH5ipW0yTySEKEdmlwsefyMHuSa9KkArfAHERWzNUQ0tOMlJIMElFUEVLNTM0T0RHMk9XSDZaSy4u). If you want to be considered for a short or whiteboard talks, please reply by February 22nd.

  <h3>Machine learning models to model antigen immunogenicity and T-cell recognition</h3>
<p>Antigen immunogenicity and the specificity of binding of T-cell receptors to antigens are key properties underlying effective immune responses. Identifying immunogenic antigens, as well as antigen-specific T-cell receptors, is therefore crucial to vaccine and cancer immunotherapy design. In this talk, I will discuss a set of flexible and easily interpretable methods that we have recently developed based on the machine learning scheme of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Such scheme allowed us first to build models of antigen presentation by the human leukocyte antigen class I proteins and antigen immunogenicity, which can be used to reconstruct the underlying molecular motifs and as predictors of viral epitopes and cancer neoantigens. I will next introduce RBM-based models of the complementary process of recognition by T cells of presented antigens, which are able to discriminate responses specific to different epitopes and to detect signatures of response at the T-cell repertoire level.</p>

  <h3>The discriminatory power of the T cell receptor</h3>
 <p>T cells use their T cell receptors (TCRs) to discriminate between lower-affinity self and higher-affinity non-self peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) antigens. Although the discriminatory power of the TCR is widely believed to be near-perfect, technical difficulties have hampered efforts to precisely quantify it. Using an accurate method for measuring very low TCR/pMHC affinities, we quantify the discriminatory power of the TCR. We find that TCR discrimination, although enhanced compared with conventional cell-surface receptors is imperfect: primary human T cells can respond to pMHC with affinities as low as KD âˆ¼ 1 mM. The kinetic proofreading mechanism fit our data, providing the first estimates of both the time delay (2.8 s) and number of biochemical steps (2.67) that are consistent with the extraordinary sensitivity of antigen recognition. We next identify factors that can control antigen discrimination, including the accessory receptors CD2 and LFA-1. Taken together, our findings explain why self pMHC frequently induce autoimmune diseases and anti-tumour responses, and suggest ways to modify TCR discrimination for improved therapies.</p>

  <h3>Physical membrane properties protect cytotoxic T cells from suicide</h3>
  <p>To eliminate virus-infected and tumour cells, cytotoxic T cells form a synapse with their target, in which they release pro-apoptotic granzymes as well as pore forming proteins called perforin. Perforin punches holes in the target membrane to facilitate cell entry for the granzymes, which next initiate a signalling cascade leading to programmed cell death (apoptosis). It has long been a mystery what protected the T cells from being targeted by the proteins they secrete to kill their targets. I will report on recent studies that have identified such self-protection mechanisms based on the physical properties of the T cell membrane. Notably, enhanced lipid order and packing reduce perforin binding, whereas externalisation of negatively charged lipids results in local deactivation of perforin. This raises the yet unanswered question if similar membrane-based protection could be used by cancer cells to evade immune killing.
