The London Quantitative Immunology Network brings together researchers from across institutions with a shared interest in using quantitative approaches to study immune defence. Our informal network is open to all.

We are particularly focused on giving early-career researchers opportunities to network and present their research. Through our events we hope to facilitate lasting interdisciplinary connections within this newly emerging field. Come join us!
