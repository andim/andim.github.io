The London Quantitative Immunology Network was created in 2023 to bring together researchers from different institutions with a shared interest in using quantitative approaches to study immune defence. Our informal network is open to all.

You can sign up to our mailing list by sending an email to ii.ldnqimmuno-join at ucl.ac.uk  

This list serves to facilitate distributing announcement about events, open positions, and the like among its members.

Our group is particularly focused on giving early-career reserarchers opportunities to network and present their research. Through our events we hope to facilitate lasting interdisciplinary connections within this newly emerging field. Come join us!

Next meeting:
