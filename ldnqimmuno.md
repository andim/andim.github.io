The London Quantitative Immunology Day is a one day symposium organized to bring together researchers from across London interested in the quantitative life sciences. Immunology is being transformed through a multitude of quantitative approaches, and correspondingly we expect the day to be of interest to researchers from diverse backgrounds from immunology, evolution, and cell biology, to systems biology, bioinformatics, and the physics of living systems. No matter your background, you are welcome to join us!

We aim to gather researchers with an interest in quantitative immunology in the London area in order to create an opportunity for sharing knowledge and social exchange. It is going to be a day of conviviality and scientific enthusiasm with a dynamic and informal atmosphere. In the program, talks of the invited speakers are interleaved with short presentations by young investigators (contributions welcome!). The schedule includes ample breaks for discussions and, for those interested, we propose to conclude the day in a local pub.

There is no registration fee, but we encourage prior registration to help us gauge attendance.
