# LDN Q-Immuno Network

The London Quantitative Immunology Network brings together researchers from across institutions with a shared interest in using **mathematical models, quantitative methods, and genomic approaches** to understand the immune system and its interactions. Our informal network is open to all.

We are particularly focused on giving early-career researchers opportunities to network and present their research. Through our events we hope to facilitate lasting interdisciplinary connections within this newly emerging field. Come join us!
