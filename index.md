I lead a research group in the [Division of Infection and Immunity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/infection-immunity/) at University College London with a focus on quantitative immunology and biological physics.  

I was previously at the [Princeton Center for the Physics of Biological Function](https://biophysics.princeton.edu/), and I maintain collaborations with the theoretical biophysics groups of Profs. Bill Bialek, Curt Callan, and Ned Wingreen.
