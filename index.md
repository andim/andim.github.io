#### Our lab's mission is to use computation and theory to understand immunology quantitatively.

We are a Quantitative Immunology research group in the [Division of Infection and Immunity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/infection-immunity/) at UCL. 

Our approaches are often rooted in ideas from biological physics and we are part of UCL's [Institute for the Physics of Living Systems](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-living-systems/).

Our research builds on strong collaborative links within the [Innate2Adaptive lab group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/infection-immunity/research/research-department-infection/lab-research-groups/innate2adaptive) and with other groups across UCL and beyond.

You can contact us via [email](mailto:andimscience@gmail.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/andimscience).

We are thrilled to be part of the [Institute of Immunity and Transplantation](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/immunity-transplantation/), a new hub for immunology research located in central North London in a stunning building within walking distance to Hampstead Heath.
