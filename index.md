I am a research fellow at the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University working on topics in theoretical biophysics and quantitative immunology.

In my work I collaborate with other members of the [Princeton Center for the Physics of Biological Function](https://biophysics.princeton.edu/), in particular the theoretical biophysics groups of Profs. Bill Bialek, Curt Callan, and Ned Wingreen.
