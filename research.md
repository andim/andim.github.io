Why are the strategies organisms have evolved to defend against pathogens so diverse across the tree of life? How does the adaptive immune system self-organize its repertoire of specific cells to provide protection against diverse and variable threats? To work towards an answer to these and similar questions I construct and analyze conceptual mathematical models aiming to capture some of the relevant trade-offs under which these biological systems operate. In my work I use ideas and tools from statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and the theory of stochastic processes.
